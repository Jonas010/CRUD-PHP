# CRUD-PHP
A simple code in php for a CRUD structure.

The database from the project is very simple,you just need create the database and next the table with the columns (tadaa :3).
You can use the same table that a was used in this project,is simples:

```
CREATE DATABASE testes;
```

And the table:

```
CREATE TABLE `testes`.`CRUD` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(190) NOT NULL,
  `age` INT(2) NOT NULL,
  `email` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

>Good luck :)
